## 2703. Return Length of Arguments Passed
Solved
Easy
Companies
Write a function argumentsLength that returns the count of arguments passed to it. 

* function arguments
* rest parameters

## Time and Space Complexity:

   * Time Complexity:
    The time complexity of this solution is O(1)O(1) in terms of how the function computes the result. Accessing args.length is a constant-time operation.

   * Space Complexity:
    The space complexity is O(n)O(n), where nn is the number of arguments passed to the function. This is because the arguments are stored in the args array, which grows linearly with the number of arguments.
