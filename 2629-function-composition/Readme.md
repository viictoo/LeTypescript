### Editorial: Solving the Function Composition Problem in TypeScript(strongly typed)

In this editorial, we will explore the problem of composing an array of functions, a concept fundamental to functional programming. The goal is to take a sequence of functions and combine them into one function, such that the output of each function becomes the input of the next, ultimately yielding a new function that performs the composition.

#### Problem Overview:

We are given an array of functions, each accepting and returning a single integer. The task is to create a function that represents the composition of these functions, applying them from right to left. Let's break it down with an example:

If we have three functions:  
- \( f(x) = x + 1 \)  
- \( g(x) = x * 2 \)  
- \( h(x) = x - 3 \)  

The composition of these functions would be:  
\[ f(g(h(x))) = f(g(x - 3)) = f((x - 3) * 2) = ((x - 3) * 2) + 1 \]

Notice that the functions are applied in reverse order, with the last function in the list being applied first.

#### Problem Constraints:
1. The input functions are given in an array, and we are tasked with returning a single function.
2. If the array of functions is empty, we should return the identity function \( f(x) = x \).

#### Solution Explanation:

The problem at hand requires composing multiple functions such that each function is applied to the result of the next function in the sequence, starting from the last function in the array and moving backwards. This is known as **right-to-left function composition**.

In TypeScript, we can leverage the `reduceRight` method to apply the functions in reverse order. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

```typescript
type F = (x: number) => number;

function compose(functions: F[]): F {
    return x => functions.reduceRight((accumulator, currFn) => currFn(accumulator), x);
}
```

##### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Type Definition**:  
   We define a function type `F` which takes a number as input and returns a number. This ensures that each function in the `functions` array conforms to this signature.

   ```typescript
   type F = (x: number) => number;
   ```

2. **Using `reduceRight`**:  
   The key to solving this problem efficiently is using `reduceRight`, which processes the array from the rightmost element to the leftmost. The `reduceRight` function iterates over the array of functions and applies each function to the result of the previous function (or the initial value, in this case, the input `x`).

   ```typescript
   return x => functions.reduceRight((accumulator, currFn) => currFn(accumulator), x);
   ```

   - **Accumulator**: The result of applying the previous function. Initially, this is the input value `x`.
   - **Current Function (`currFn`)**: The current function in the array, which is applied to the accumulator (or the previous result).
   - The `reduceRight` method continues applying each function from right to left, ultimately returning the result of applying all the functions to the input `x`.

3. **Identity Function for Empty Array**:  
   If the `functions` array is empty, the identity function (which simply returns the input value unchanged) is automatically returned because `reduceRight` would not modify the input value. This behavior is guaranteed by the default `x` value passed as the second argument to `reduceRight`.

#### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**:  
  The time complexity is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of functions in the array. This is because we iterate over the functions exactly once.

- **Space Complexity**:  
  The space complexity is \( O(1) \) (ignoring the input array), as we only use a constant amount of additional space to store the accumulator and the result.

#### Edge Cases:

1. **Empty Functions Array**:  
   If the array is empty, the function should return the identity function, i.e., \( f(x) = x \). This is automatically handled by `reduceRight`.

2. **Single Function**:  
   If the array contains only one function, the result is simply that function, as no composition is needed.

3. **Multiple Functions**:  
   The solution works efficiently for arrays containing multiple functions by applying the composition in a right-to-left manner.

#### Conclusion:

The solution to the problem of function composition is elegant and efficient. By using the `reduceRight` method, we can easily compose functions in the correct order with minimal code and optimal performance. This approach also handles edge cases like an empty array gracefully. The ability to compose functions in this way is a powerful tool in functional programming and is widely applicable in real-world scenarios where function transformations need to be applied dynamically.

This solution demonstrates how functional programming principles—such as immutability and higher-order functions—can be implemented effectively in TypeScript, leading to clean, maintainable, and performant code.
