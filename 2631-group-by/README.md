##  2631. Group By
Medium

Write code that enhances all arrays such that you can call the array.groupBy(fn) method on any array and it will return a grouped version of the array.

A grouped array is an object where each key is the output of fn(arr[i]) and each value is an array containing all items in the original array which generate that key.

The provided callback fn will accept an item in the array and return a string key.

The order of each value list should be the order the items appear in the array. Any order of keys is acceptable.

Please solve it without lodash's _.groupBy function.

Example 1:

Input: 
array = [
  {"id":"1"},
  {"id":"1"},
  {"id":"2"}
], 
fn = function (item) { 
  return item.id; 
}
Output: 
{ 
  "1": [{"id": "1"}, {"id": "1"}],   
  "2": [{"id": "2"}] 
}
