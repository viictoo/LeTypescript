* 2665. Counter II

Write a function createCounter. It should accept an initial integer init.
It should return an object with three functions.

The three functions are:

    increment() increases the current value by 1 and then returns it.
    decrement() reduces the current value by 1 and then returns it.
    reset() sets the current value to init and then returns it.

Key Concepts:

    Encapsulation: The counter's state is maintained privately inside the
	closure. This prevents external code from directly modifying the
	counterâ€™s value, while still allowing interaction through the defined methods.
    
  Closures: The createCounter function defines a private variable init 
	(representing the initial value) and
	a private save variable to store the original value. These variables are not 
	directly accessible outside createCounter but are retained inside the
	closures created by the increment, decrement, and reset methods.
