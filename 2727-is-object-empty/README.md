Given an object or an array, return if it is empty.

    An empty object contains no key-value pairs.
    An empty array contains no elements.

You may assume the object or array is the output of JSON.parse.

1. Object.keys(obj).length === 0 O(n)

2. JSON.stringify(obj).length '{}' O(n)

3. For loop O(1) W


### Overview

There are several methods to check if an object or array is empty. These methods include using `Object.keys()`, stringifying the object with `JSON.stringify()`, and using a `for...in` loop to iterate over the properties of the object or array. Each method has different performance implications based on the size of the input.

### Approach

1. **Using `Object.keys(obj).length === 0` (O(n))**  
   This approach calls `Object.keys(obj)` to retrieve all the keys of the object and then checks if the length of the resulting array is 0. For arrays, this is equivalent to checking if the length property is 0. The time complexity here is **O(n)** because `Object.keys()` has to iterate over all properties in the object to create an array of keys.

2. **Using `JSON.stringify(obj).length` (O(n))**  
   This method converts the object into a string using `JSON.stringify()` and checks if the resulting string is `'{}` for an empty object or `'[]'` for an empty array. The time complexity here is also **O(n)** due to the need to serialize the entire object into a string.

3. **Using a `for...in` loop (O(1) in best-case scenario)**  
   A more efficient approach is using a `for...in` loop to iterate over the object's properties. If a property is found, the loop can immediately return `false`, indicating the object is not empty. The time complexity is **O(1)** in the best-case scenario (if the object is empty or has very few properties). This method avoids building an array or string and terminates early when an element is found.

### Complexity Analysis

- **`Object.keys(obj).length === 0` (O(n))**: This method creates an array of all keys, iterating over the object, which results in linear time complexity with respect to the number of properties in the object (`n`).
  
- **`JSON.stringify(obj).length` (O(n))**: Similarly, this approach serializes the entire object into a string, which takes linear time relative to the number of properties in the object.
  
- **`for...in` loop (O(1) best-case scenario)**: In the case of an empty object or array, the loop terminates immediately, resulting in constant time complexity. If the object contains properties, the time complexity is proportional to the number of properties (`O(n)`), but this is a better option for early termination.

### Tips

- **For performance**, prefer the `for...in` loop when you need to check for empty objects, especially when the input could be large or deeply nested.
- **Avoid `Object.keys()` and `JSON.stringify()`** for large objects, as they involve creating new arrays or strings, leading to higher memory consumption and slower performance.
- If you are working with **nested structures** (arrays of objects or objects with arrays), consider recursively checking for emptiness to handle deeply nested cases efficiently.
